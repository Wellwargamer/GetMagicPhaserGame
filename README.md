# Title: GetMagicPhaserGame
First Phaser game with GetMagic Mentor
# Summary: 
A simple collecting and avoiding game, the player and the items will spawn in and drop down onto a platform. Use the arrow keys to move your character. Left arrow to move left, right arrow to move right, and up arrow to jump. Your goal is to collect all the skulls in each level to get a high score, but as you progress, the task becomes harder. After every level, a little ‘bomb’ will appear, bouncing around the map. While collecting the skulls, you have to avoid the bomb or it’s game over. Game was developed on JavaScript and Python using Sublime. Challenges were figuring out the coordinate points for the specific location, such as pictures and platforms.

# Gameplay:
Player will spawn and bounce in, along with 'skulls' to collect. Use arrow keys up, left, and right to move. When collecting, the game will make a little 'ping' noise. After collecting all skulls on one level, the game will restart with a bomb. The Player will continue the same task each level, this time avoiding the bombs. The bombs will not disappear from the previous levels but will add 1 each time. 
# Changes: 
The amount of skulls can be changed inside of the code, along with the amount of bounce for the bombs and skulls. The skull value can be changed. Users can also change the background pictures, platform pictures, and the Player itself within the code.
